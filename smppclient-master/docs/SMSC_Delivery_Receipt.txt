Request delivery reports from the provider
The best way to check the status of each message sent, is to ask for delivery reports. This can be done by setting the 'registered_delivery' value of the 'submit_sm' packet. This parameter can have one of the following values:

Value	Meaning
0	Do not send delivery reports
1	Always send delivery reports
2	Send delivery report in case of an error
3	Send delivery report only when message is delivered

By setting this value to '1', the provider will send a delivery report to the client every time the status of this message changes. You can set this value per message.
The delivery reports are sent to the client using the 'deliver_sm' packet. This is the same packet as used to deliver incoming messages. To detect whether a 'deliver_sm' is a delivery report or a message, you have to check the 'esm_class' field. If bit 2 of this byte is set ( 0x04 ), it is a delivery report. To use delivery reports, you have to setup a transceiver connection to the SMPP provider, because you are going to send and receive messages. The delivery status is encoded in the 'short_message' field as an ASCII text message. This format is product specific, but the following format is used by most SMPP providers:

Field	Meaning
id	The message reference of the message.
sub	Sub-ID, not used.
dlvrd	Value '1' when the message has been delivered, if the message is still pending '0'.
submit date	Submission date and time.
done date	Date and time the status has changed, or message delivery time when stat is set to 'DELIVRD'.
stat	Current status of the message.
err	Additional error code, provider specific.
text	Part of the original message text.

When using SMPP version 3.4, sometimes the message has some optional parameters (TLV's) attached containing the message state, message reference and a network error code. Please refer to the SMPP version 3.4 documentation on how to use these TLV's.
